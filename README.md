# Robotics Localization

ROS (C++) implementation of a particle filter in conjunction with dead-reckoning for localization of a mobile robot (KTH robotics project). The Armadillo C++ linear algebra library was used for matrix multiplication.

The map was represented as a list of line segments (coordinates of end-points) which was givenat the beginning of the competition.
